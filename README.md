# Movie Nomination App

## About the Project: 📚

This is a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favorite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project.
